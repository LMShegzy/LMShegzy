Name: Luka, Manasseh Shegnanzna
Course: Data Science
Module 1 Mini project on Introduction to Data and Data Science.

Introduction 
Students are welcomed and informed that the course will provide us with the necessary precepts to becoming a Data Scientist. This processes will involve comprehensive learning for 16 weeks and real capstone project for 32 weeks. The course is made up of 6 modules namely: introduction to data, data science and python programming basics, python for Data science, mathematics for data science, exploratory data analysis, inferential statistics and machine learning. 
The goal of this course reads: to make learning fun, practical, and directly applicable to solving real-world problem and driving innovative solutions
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
Fundamental knowledge of data, data science and its processes as well as career paths,
Object-oriented programming, modules, exception handling, regular expressions and basic database interactions to prepare for more complex programming task,
Python programming elements as relate to data science, and 
Problem solving skills will be acquired.

DATA
Data is basically raw information about an event, collected over a period of time. It can be image(s), words, figures, etc.
IMPORTANCE OF DATA
The importance of data cannot be overemphasized as it is employed in
Informed decision about a crucial issue at hand.
Uncovering of patterns and trends
Solving of complex problems.
DATA SCIENCE
Data is on the rise. As we evolve, data is becoming more and more useful than it has ever been. Data Science Experts are needed to utilise this available information to help make effective decisions and also to forecast the future patterns.
Data Science is therefore the art of utilizing mathematics, statistics, coding and domain expertise to extract meaningful information and use it to build predictive models.
DATA SCIENCE ROADMAP
Data science involves series of processes, they are:
Data Collection: this involves the process of sourcing for data, usually through surveys, sensors, social media, transaction etc 
Data Cleaning: this involves the process of removing duplicate informations and filling the missing informations as well as correcting errors contained in the data available.
Exploratory Data Analysis: this is the phase where the Data Scientist dig into gain understanding of the data structure and trends. The Data Scientist uses data visualization tools to gain achieve this.
Modelling: this involves the use of statistical methods and machine learning algorithms by the Data Scientist to create models that can predict outcomes or classify information.
Evaluation: this involves testing the effectiveness of the model developed.
Deployment and Monitoring: this involves the deployment of the developed model for usage and observation for efficiency of outcomes.
Why Data Science can't be taken over by AI
There are numerous reasons why Data Science can't be taken over by AI. They are:
Data Cleaning and Preparation: AI is smart yet, it can only assist with data cleaning. Data cleaning and preparation requires the expertise of human to get the right thing done. For instance, certainly anomalies that can be seen as error b AI could actually be essential patterns.
Human insight and definition of problem: As powerful as AI is, it lacks the insight that humans has regarding a problem and the objectives for solving the problem.
Model selection and interpretation: AI as the power of selecting models automatically but interpretation is usually not consistent hence the need of human involvement.
Ethics and bias in data science.
CAREER OPPORTUNITIES IN THE DATA FIELD
There numerous careers opportunities in Data field. It is so due to the fact that they are needed to execute different roles and that also requires different skills and tools.
Analytics Engineer: combine both software engineering and data skills to build a robust pipelines and ensure data availability for analysis. Sunch an individual is proficient in using SQL, data modelling, ETL development and analytics tool,
Data Architect: design and manage data architecture, including data storage, organisation, and maintenance, ensuring data integrity and security. Such an individual is proficient in database design, data modelling, SQL, data warehousing, and cloud infrastructure,
Data Engineer: focuses on creating infrastructures for data generation, storage and accessible. Useful skills includes:SQL, data pipeline creation, ETL,
Business Intelligence,
Data Science Consultant,
Data Analyst,
Data Scientist, etc.
